# Reindeer-Rain
A game about dodging raining reindeers from the sky. This was so much fun to make.

Move the elf left and right to dodge the raining reindeers and collect power-ups to heal and protect yourself.

Also has a fancy leaderboard that displays high scores

Can you beat my high score?

I also used cx_Freeze to freeze the game into a Windows executable so it can run on any Windows computer.
